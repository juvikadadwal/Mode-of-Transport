# Mode-of-Transport
You work for an office transport company. You are in discussions with ABC Consulting company for
providing transport for their employees. For this purpose, you are tasked with understanding how do the
employees of ABC Consulting prefer to commute presently (between home and office). Based on the
parameters like age, salary, work experience etc. given in the data set ‘Transport.csv’, you are required to
predict the preferred mode of transport. The project requires you to build several Machine Learning
models and compare them so that the model can be finalised.
